   food_name: Lamb kebabs with kisir


   description: Mediterranean-inspired lamb kebabs signals easy summer entertaining and a long, laidback afresco lunch.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds, ground
 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
 3/4 teaspoon each turmeric, garam masala, ground coriander, ground cardamom and ground cinnamon
 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
 2 garlic cloves, chopped
 Juice of 1 lemon
 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
 1/2 bunch coriander, roughly chopped
 4 lamb backstraps, cut into 2cm pieces
 1 cup (280g) thick Greek-style yoghurt
 2 tablespoons harissa (see note)
 Flatbread (recipe follows) and micro coriander, to serve (see note)
   preparation_method: Place dry spices, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, oil and half the coriander in a small food processor and whiz until a paste. Season, then coat lamb in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
For the kisir, place the burghul in a bowl and add enough cold water to cover, then stand for 30 minutes at room temperature until water is absorbed. Place onion in a bowl with lemon juice and soak for 30 minutes. Drain the burghul in a fine sieve pressing down to extract excess water. Place in a serving bowl with onion mixture and remaining ingredients, then season and stir to combine. Set aside.
Soak 8 wooden skewers in cold water. Preheat a chargrill pan or barbecue to medium-high heat. Bring lamb to room temperature.

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

   food_name: Portuguese-style chicken with warm corn salad


   description: Spicy, fragrant, sweet and utterly scrumptious, roast chicken doesn't get much better than this.

   ingredients: 1.6kg chicken, rinsed, patted dry
 3 lemons
 1/3 cup oregano leaves, chopped
 2 teaspoons dried ground oregano
 4 red bird's-eye chillies, seeded, finely chopped
 1 tablespoon brown sugar
 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
 2 teaspoons lemon thyme leaves (see note)
 1 1/2 tablespoons sweet paprika
 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra, to brush
 4 cobs corn, husks and silks removed
 250g cherry truss tomatoes
 1 cup coriander sprigs
   preparation_method: Place chicken, breast-side down, on work surface. Using poultry shears or a cleaver, cut down either side of backbone, then remove and discard.
Turn chicken breast-side up. Using the palm of your hand, push down breast to flatten. Tuck wings under breast bone. Push a metal skewer diagonally through wing to thigh on opposite side. Repeat with remaining skewer on other side to create a cross.
Place chicken in a large baking dish. Zest and juice 1 lemon in a small bowl. Add oregano, chillies, sugar, garlic, lemon thyme, 1 tablespoon paprika and 11?2 tablespoons oil. Stir to combine. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour lemon mixture over chicken and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to marinate.
Preheat barbecue to high. Cook chicken on grill for 5 minutes each side or until golden. Transfer to one side of barbecue plate, close lid and cook over indirect heat for 30 minutes or until juices run clear when the thickest part of thigh is pierced. Transfer to a plate, cover with foil and rest for 10 minutes.

   preparation_method: Place chicken, breast-side down, on work surface. Using poultry shears or a cleaver, cut down either side of backbone, then remove and discard.
Turn chicken breast-side up. Using the palm of your hand, push down breast to flatten. Tuck wings under breast bone. Push a metal skewer diagonally through wing to thigh on opposite side. Repeat with remaining skewer on other side to create a cross.
Place chicken in a large baking dish. Zest and juice 1 lemon in a small bowl. Add oregano, chillies, sugar, garlic, lemon thyme, 1 tablespoon paprika and 11?2 tablespoons oil. Stir to combine. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour lemon mixture over chicken and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to marinate.
Preheat barbecue to high. Cook chicken on grill for 5 minutes each side or until golden. Transfer to one side of barbecue plate, close lid and cook over indirect heat for 30 minutes or until juices run clear when the thickest part of thigh is pierced. Transfer to a plate, cover with foil and rest for 10 minutes.

   description: Mediterranean-inspired lamb kebabs signals easy summer entertaining and a long, laidback afresco lunch.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds, ground
 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
 3/4 teaspoon each turmeric, garam masala, ground coriander, ground cardamom and ground cinnamon
 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
 2 garlic cloves, chopped
 Juice of 1 lemon
 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil

 4 lamb backstraps, cut into 2cm pieces
 1 cup (280g) thick Greek-style yoghurt
 2 tablespoons harissa (see note)

   description: Spicy, fragrant, sweet and utterly scrumptious, roast chicken doesn't get much better than this.

   ingredients: 1.6kg chicken, rinsed, patted dry
 3 lemons
 1/3 cup oregano leaves, chopped
 2 teaspoons dried ground oregano
 4 red bird's-eye chillies, seeded, finely chopped

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

 6 dried juniper berries (see notes), lightly crushed
 2 bay leaves, crushed

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

   ingredients: 10 thyme sprigs, leaves picked
 12 whole black peppercorns

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

 3 lemons
 1/3 cup oregano leaves, chopped
 2 teaspoons dried ground oregano
 4 red bird's-eye chillies, seeded, finely chopped
 1 tablespoon brown sugar

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

   food_name: Lamb kebabs with kisir


   description: Mediterranean-inspired lamb kebabs signals easy summer entertaining and a long, laidback afresco lunch.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds, ground
 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
 3/4 teaspoon each turmeric, garam masala, ground coriander, ground cardamom and ground cinnamon
 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
 2 garlic cloves, chopped
 Juice of 1 lemon
 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
 1/2 bunch coriander, roughly chopped
 4 lamb backstraps, cut into 2cm pieces
 1 cup (280g) thick Greek-style yoghurt
 2 tablespoons harissa (see note)
 Flatbread (recipe follows) and micro coriander, to serve (see note)
   preparation_method: Place dry spices, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, oil and half the coriander in a small food processor and whiz until a paste. Season, then coat lamb in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
For the kisir, place the burghul in a bowl and add enough cold water to cover, then stand for 30 minutes at room temperature until water is absorbed. Place onion in a bowl with lemon juice and soak for 30 minutes. Drain the burghul in a fine sieve pressing down to extract excess water.

   food_name: Portuguese-style chicken with warm corn salad


   description: Spicy, fragrant, sweet and utterly scrumptious, roast chicken doesn't get much better than this.

   ingredients: 1.6kg chicken, rinsed, patted dry
 3 lemons
 1/3 cup oregano leaves, chopped
 2 teaspoons dried ground oregano
 4 red bird's-eye chillies, seeded, finely chopped
 1 tablespoon brown sugar
 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
 2 teaspoons lemon thyme leaves (see note)
 1 1/2 tablespoons sweet paprika
 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra, to brush
 4 cobs corn, husks and silks removed
 250g cherry truss tomatoes
 1 cup coriander sprigs
   preparation_method: Place chicken, breast-side down, on work surface. Using poultry shears or a cleaver, cut down either side of backbone, then remove and discard.
Turn chicken breast-side up. Using the palm of your hand, push down breast to flatten. Tuck wings under breast bone. Push a metal skewer diagonally through wing to thigh on opposite side. Repeat with remaining skewer on other side to create a cross.

Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour lemon mixture over chicken and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to marinate.
Preheat barbecue to high. Cook chicken on grill for 5 minutes each side or until golden. Transfer to one side of barbecue plate, close lid and cook over indirect heat for 30 minutes or until juices run clear when the thickest part of thigh is pierced. Transfer to a plate, cover with foil and rest for 10 minutes.

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

   food_name: Lamb kebabs with kisir


   description: Mediterranean-inspired lamb kebabs signals easy summer entertaining and a long, laidback afresco lunch.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds, ground
 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
 3/4 teaspoon each turmeric, garam masala, ground coriander, ground cardamom and ground cinnamon
 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
 2 garlic cloves, chopped
 Juice of 1 lemon
 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil

 2 tablespoons harissa (see note)
 Flatbread (recipe follows) and micro coriander, to serve (see note)
   preparation_method: Place dry spices, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, oil and half the coriander in a small food processor and whiz until a paste. Season, then coat lamb in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.

   food_name: Portuguese-style chicken with warm corn salad


   description: Spicy, fragrant, sweet and utterly scrumptious, roast chicken doesn't get much better than this.

   ingredients: 1.6kg chicken, rinsed, patted dry
 3 lemons
 1/3 cup oregano leaves, chopped
 2 teaspoons dried ground oregano
 4 red bird's-eye chillies, seeded, finely chopped
 1 tablespoon brown sugar
 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
 2 teaspoons lemon thyme leaves (see note)
 1 1/2 tablespoons sweet paprika
 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra, to brush
 4 cobs corn, husks and silks removed
 250g cherry truss tomatoes
 1 cup coriander sprigs
   preparation_method: Place chicken, breast-side down, on work surface. Using poultry shears or a cleaver, cut down either side of backbone, then remove and discard.
Turn chicken breast-side up. Using the palm of your hand, push down breast to flatten. Tuck wings under breast bone. Push a metal skewer diagonally through wing to thigh on opposite side. Repeat with remaining skewer on other side to create a cross.

Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour lemon mixture over chicken and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to marinate.
Preheat barbecue to high. Cook chicken on grill for 5 minutes each side or until golden. Transfer to one side of barbecue plate, close lid and cook over indirect heat for 30 minutes or until juices run clear when the thickest part of thigh is pierced. Transfer to a plate, cover with foil and rest for 10 minutes.

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

   ingredients: 10 thyme sprigs, leaves picked
 12 whole black peppercorns

   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

 1 cup (280g) thick Greek-style yoghurt
 2 tablespoons harissa (see note)
 Flatbread (recipe follows) and micro coriander, to serve (see note)
   preparation_method: Place dry spices, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, oil and half the coriander in a small food processor and whiz until a paste. Season, then coat lamb in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
For the kisir, place the burghul in a bowl and add enough cold water to cover, then stand for 30 minutes at room temperature until water is absorbed. Place onion in a bowl with lemon juice and soak for 30 minutes. Drain the burghul in a fine sieve pressing down to extract excess water. Place in a serving bowl with onion mixture and remaining ingredients, then season and stir to combine. Set aside.
Soak 8 wooden skewers in cold water. Preheat a chargrill pan or barbecue to medium-high heat. Bring lamb to room temperature.
Thread the lamb onto skewers (or use clean twigs) and cook, turning, for 4-5 minutes for medium-rare or until cooked to your liking. Rest, loosely covered with foil, for 5 minutes.

   food_name: Portuguese-style chicken with warm corn salad


   description: Spicy, fragrant, sweet and utterly scrumptious, roast chicken doesn't get much better than this.

   ingredients: 1.6kg chicken, rinsed, patted dry
 3 lemons
 1/3 cup oregano leaves, chopped
 2 teaspoons dried ground oregano
 4 red bird's-eye chillies, seeded, finely chopped
 1 tablespoon brown sugar
 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
 2 teaspoons lemon thyme leaves (see note)
 1 1/2 tablespoons sweet paprika
 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra, to brush
 4 cobs corn, husks and silks removed
 250g cherry truss tomatoes

Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour lemon mixture over chicken and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to marinate.
Preheat barbecue to high. Cook chicken on grill for 5 minutes each side or until golden. Transfer to one side of barbecue plate, close lid and cook over indirect heat for 30 minutes or until juices run clear when the thickest part of thigh is pierced. Transfer to a plate, cover with foil and rest for 10 minutes.

 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.

 3/4 teaspoon each turmeric, garam masala, ground coriander, ground cardamom and ground cinnamon
 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
 2 garlic cloves, chopped
 Juice of 1 lemon
 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
 1/2 bunch coriander, roughly chopped
 4 lamb backstraps, cut into 2cm pieces
 1 cup (280g) thick Greek-style yoghurt
 2 tablespoons harissa (see note)
 Flatbread (recipe follows) and micro coriander, to serve (see note)
   preparation_method: Place dry spices, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, oil and half the coriander in a small food processor and whiz until a paste. Season, then coat lamb in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
For the kisir, place the burghul in a bowl and add enough cold water to cover, then stand for 30 minutes at room temperature until water is absorbed. Place onion in a bowl with lemon juice and soak for 30 minutes. Drain the burghul in a fine sieve pressing down to extract excess water. Place in a serving bowl with onion mixture and remaining ingredients, then season and stir to combine. Set aside.

Thread the lamb onto skewers (or use clean twigs) and cook, turning, for 4-5 minutes for medium-rare or until cooked to your liking. Rest, loosely covered with foil, for 5 minutes.

   description: Spicy, fragrant, sweet and utterly scrumptious, roast chicken doesn't get much better than this.

   ingredients: 1.6kg chicken, rinsed, patted dry
 3 lemons
 1/3 cup oregano leaves, chopped
 2 teaspoons dried ground oregano
 4 red bird's-eye chillies, seeded, finely chopped
 1 tablespoon brown sugar

Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour lemon mixture over chicken and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to marinate.
Preheat barbecue to high. Cook chicken on grill for 5 minutes each side or until golden. Transfer to one side of barbecue plate, close lid and cook over indirect heat for 30 minutes or until juices run clear when the thickest part of thigh is pierced. Transfer to a plate, cover with foil and rest for 10 minutes.

 6 dried juniper berries (see notes), lightly crushed
 2 bay leaves, crushed
 5 garlic cloves, finely chopped
 4 chicken marylands
 1L (4 cups) olive oil
 Steamed green beans and pommes puree (see related recipe), to serve

   food_name: Lamb kebabs with kisir


   description: Mediterranean-inspired lamb kebabs signals easy summer entertaining and a long, laidback afresco lunch.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds, ground
 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
 3/4 teaspoon each turmeric, garam masala, ground coriander, ground cardamom and ground cinnamon
 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
 2 garlic cloves, chopped
 Juice of 1 lemon
 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
 1/2 bunch coriander, roughly chopped
 4 lamb backstraps, cut into 2cm pieces
 1 cup (280g) thick Greek-style yoghurt
 2 tablespoons harissa (see note)
 Flatbread (recipe follows) and micro coriander, to serve (see note)
   preparation_method: Place dry spices, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, oil and half the coriander in a small food processor and whiz until a paste. Season, then coat lamb in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.

   ingredients: 1.6kg chicken, rinsed, patted dry
 3 lemons
 1/3 cup oregano leaves, chopped
 2 teaspoons dried ground oregano
 4 red bird's-eye chillies, seeded, finely chopped
 1 tablespoon brown sugar

Transfer to one side of barbecue plate, close lid and cook over indirect heat for 30 minutes or until juices run clear when the thickest part of thigh is pierced. Transfer to a plate, cover with foil and rest for 10 minutes.

   food_name: Spicy-sweet nuts


   description: Throwing a Christmas party at home? Send your guests off with a delicious take-home food gift like Curtis Stone's spicy-sweet nuts.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 cups raw cashews
 1 1/2 cups raw pecans
 1 cup raw whole almonds
 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons raw sugar
 2 teaspoons fleur de sel
 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
 1 tablespoon honey
 1 tablespoon molasses
 2 teaspoons coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
 1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
   preparation_method: Preheat the oven to 175Â°C (150Â°C).
Arrange the cashews, pecans, and almonds in an even layer over a heavy large baking tray. Roast for 8 minutes, or just until the nuts are hot.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the raw sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, cayenne, and paprika to blend.
Transfer the nuts to the sugar-spice mixture in the large bowl. Add the honey, molasses, rosemary, and orange, and stir to coat.
Line the same baking tray with nonstick foil and return the nut mixture to the baking sheet, spreading them out in an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons raw sugar and 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel over the nuts and roast for about 15 minutes, or until the nuts are toasted. Cool slightly, then separate the nuts, or keep them in small clusters, if desired.
Cool completely before serving. The coating on the nuts will harden as the nuts cool.
