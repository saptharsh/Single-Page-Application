   food_name: Lamb kebabs with kisir


   description: Mediterranean-inspired lamb kebabs signals easy summer entertaining and a long, laidback afresco lunch.

   ingredients: 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds, ground
 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
 3/4 teaspoon each turmeric, garam masala, ground coriander, ground cardamom and ground cinnamon
 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
 2 garlic cloves, chopped
 Juice of 1 lemon
 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
 1/2 bunch coriander, roughly chopped

 1 cup (280g) thick Greek-style yoghurt
 2 tablespoons harissa (see note)

   preparation_method: Place dry spices, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, oil and half the coriander in a small food processor and whiz until a paste. Season, then coat lamb in marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.

 3 lemons
 1/3 cup oregano leaves, chopped
 2 teaspoons dried ground oregano
 4 red bird's-eye chillies, seeded, finely chopped
